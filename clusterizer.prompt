Develop an interactive Streamlit application in Python that takes a dataset with a variable number of columns as input. The application should provide the following functionalities:  Input Dataset:  Accept a CSV or Excel file containing the dataset. Dynamically detect the number of columns and allow the user to preview the dataset. Column Selection:  Allow the user to select columns for clustering. Provide an option to choose columns for statistical analysis (optional). Optionally, let the user specify an index column. Clustering:  Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) on the selected columns. Generate a 2D t-SNE chart to visualize the clusters. Statistics:  If statistical columns are selected, compute and display statistics for each cluster. Provide a table summarizing the clustered columns based on the chosen statistics. Interactive Interface:  Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface. Include sliders, dropdowns, or any interactive widgets for user input. Visualization:  Display the t-SNE chart for visualizing clusters. Provide tables with cluster statistics and clustered column values. Export:  Allow the user to export the clustered dataset and cluster statistics. Documentation:  Include clear documentation on how to use the application. Provide information about the clustering algorithm used and any dependencies. Customization:  Include options for customizing the appearance of the charts (e.g., color-coding clusters). Error Handling:  Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected issues. Note: Ensure the code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices. Consider scalability and efficiency when working with large datasets
